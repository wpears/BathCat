  underwater topography. shoot sonar at a river bottom and use GPS and a motion correction unit to get XYZ
  millions of points in a grid
  [[IMAGE]]better displayed as rasters, cell per point on the grid

Quest for Profile
  draw a line over a raster, get a cross-section of the elevations along the line
  [[IMAGE]]

Identify operation of the ArcGIS Server [[IMAGE]]
What happens when you identify on a raster --> pass a point, get a pixel value
Pass a multipoint? Get a pixel value (different than if you passed a multipoint to an I sent on a census tract)
So this means many requests, all at once.

And this works...
Slowly.
  Much convoluted code to stagger requests, both for server and client
  Very spikey server interactions...Better increase minimum number of instances to ~6+ to support a single user.



A better way!
  raster's represent values via their color ramp... this is kinda the whole point of using them
    over hundreds of thousands of points
  by displaying certain colors you are already displaying the answer to the query
  if we could speak the language of the color ramp, we wouldn't have to talk to the server

Color ramps [[IMAGE]]
  color ramps contain 256 colors.
  bins for finer decimal precision
  so depending on the range of your values you might have pretty poor resolution in your ramp
  5ft -68ft ~0.25ft

How to query from color ramps?
  [[IMAGE]] DynamicMapServiceLayer.. when you pan around the map.. you get an image..
    width and heighth of the viewport
  [[IMAGE]] image is constructed with parameters based on extent, layers shown etc... things you can track and mimic
      (or monkey patch)
    canvas context's drawImage(image, 0, 0)
    
   for any x,y point, canvas context's getImageData(x, y, 1, 1)
      grab screen points of a profile, get their image data for every pixel and make cool graphs
  Generate data with every possible depth.. run identifies
